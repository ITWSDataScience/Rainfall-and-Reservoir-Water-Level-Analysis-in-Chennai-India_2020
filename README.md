General Project Idea: Rainfall and water availability

Project Description: With the curiosity for the water condition in India, the project 
tries to inspect the relationship between rainfall and available water in the reservoir 
using data collected from Chennai city. Both the reservoir rainfall dataset and the 
reservoir level dataset is used in this project in order to carry out a relationship 
between the two. The project merged the two datasets to collectively see the change in 
the water level with respect to the rainfall they receive. With the additional population
data, we also want to explore the water usage for each person in the city over the 
respective years as a further exploration. 


Data Information: The rainfall dataset shows the average rainfall received by the four 
reservoirs in Chennai city daily from 2004-2019. The reservoir level dataset includes 
data recorded daily on the reservoir level for the four reservoirs from 2004-2019. 
The population data is the population growth in Chennai city from 2004-2019.
